## DEBUGGING PATTERNS
- **Comprehensive debug logging**: Add debug statements at function entry, key decision points, and return statements
- **Error catching**: Wrap suspicious code in try-catch during debugging
- **Systematic approach**: Start from game loading chain and work inward

## SYNTAX ERROR PATTERNS
- **Duplicate functions**: Check for copy-paste errors creating duplicate function definitions
- **Incomplete functions**: Verify all functions have proper opening/closing braces
- **Try-catch mismatches**: Ensure every try has corresponding catch or finally

## PUNCH OUT SPECIFIC LEARNINGS
- Had duplicate drawPlayer() functions causing syntax errors
- Extra closing braces at end of file prevented loading
- Try block without catch caused "Missing catch or finally" error
- Function must return game instance with destroy() method

## FILE ORGANIZATION
- Keep backup files during development for quick rollback
- Use node -c filename.js to verify syntax before testing
- Remove all debug statements before committing to keep code clean

## TESTING APPROACH
- Test in browser console for immediate feedback
- Check Network tab for file loading issues
- Use browser debugger to step through problematic code
