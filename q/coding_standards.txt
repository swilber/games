Last Updated: 2025-12-03T10:53:32.213-07:00

## Q FILE MAINTENANCE
- **Update these /q files regularly** as new patterns emerge
- **Remove outdated information** that no longer applies
- **Prioritize actionable information** over historical details
- **Add new files** if better organization is needed
- **Keep information current** and relevant to ongoing work

## BACKUP PROTOCOL
1. Always create backups before making changes
2. Use naming convention: .backup, .backup2, .backup3
3. Store backups in same directory as original file
4. Delete backup files before pushing to git

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
1. Make incremental changes (one small change at a time)
2. Test after each change
3. Check syntax after each modification
4. Commit working states frequently
5. Use meaningful commit messages

## ERROR HANDLING
1. Add minimal debug statements only when debugging
2. Use backups to troubleshoot and revert if needed
3. Remove all debug statements before final commit
4. Check for syntax errors: unmatched braces, duplicate functions

## TESTING PROTOCOL
1. Provide exact testing steps to user
2. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
3. Fix issues immediately when reported
4. Test in browser console for JavaScript errors

## CODE QUALITY
- Write minimal code that directly addresses requirements
- Avoid verbose implementations
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
