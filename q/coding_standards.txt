# Coding Standards & Workflow
Last Updated: 2025-12-03T10:57:38.150-07:00

## Q FILE MAINTENANCE
- **Update these /q files regularly** as new patterns emerge
- **Remove outdated information** that no longer applies
- **Prioritize actionable information** over historical details
- **Add new files** if better organization is needed
- **Keep information current** and relevant to ongoing work
- **Update session_log.txt** with recent commands and context after significant work

## CODE QUALITY MONITORING
- **Check code_quality.txt regularly** for refactoring opportunities
- **Assess code smells** during development work
- **Prompt user for refactoring** when code becomes difficult to maintain
- **Monitor file sizes** and function complexity
- **Identify duplication** and suggest consolidation

## SESSION LOG MAINTENANCE
- Keep last 10-15 commands in session_log.txt
- Update current session summary with major changes
- Include enough context to recover from overflow
- Remove old entries when they become irrelevant
- Focus on actionable information for continuity

## GIT WORKFLOW
- **NEVER automatically push changes** - wait for explicit user instructions
- Only commit and push when user says "push changes", "commit and push", or similar
- Always create backups before making changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Test syntax before committing

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
1. Make incremental changes (one small change at a time)
2. Test after each change
3. Check syntax after each modification
4. Commit working states frequently
5. Use meaningful commit messages
6. **Assess code quality** after significant changes

## ERROR HANDLING
1. Add minimal debug statements only when debugging
2. Use backups to troubleshoot and revert if needed
3. Remove all debug statements before final commit
4. Check for syntax errors: unmatched braces, duplicate functions

## TESTING PROTOCOL
1. Provide exact testing steps to user
2. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
3. Fix issues immediately when reported
4. Test in browser console for JavaScript errors

## CODE QUALITY
- Write minimal code that directly addresses requirements
- Avoid verbose implementations
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- **Proactively identify refactoring opportunities**
