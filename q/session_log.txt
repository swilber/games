## TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BYPASS QUESTIONS FEATURE
**Prerequisites:**
1. Access debug mode with `?gubed=true` in URL
2. Click Configuration button (⚙️)

**Test Steps:**
1. **Enable Bypass Setting:**
   - Open Configuration modal
   - Ensure "System" tab is active
   - Check "Allow empty string to bypass questions (debug)" checkbox
   - Verify setting persists after closing/reopening modal

2. **Test Bypass Functionality:**
   - Complete Level 1 (any game)
   - Try to access Level 2 - should show question prompt
   - Leave answer field completely empty
   - Press Enter or click Submit
   - Should bypass question and allow access to Level 2

3. **Test Normal Operation:**
   - Uncheck bypass setting in System config
   - Try to access a locked level
   - Leave answer field empty and submit
   - Should show "Incorrect answer! Try again." error
   - Enter correct answer - should work normally

4. **Test Setting Persistence:**
   - Enable bypass, refresh page with `?gubed=true`
   - Open config - bypass should still be checked
   - Disable bypass, refresh - should be unchecked

**Expected Results:**
- Empty string bypasses questions only when setting is enabled
- Normal answer validation works when bypass is disabled
- Setting persists across browser sessions
- No bypass functionality available without debug mode

## IMPORTANT WORKFLOW CHANGE
- **DO NOT automatically push to git** - wait for explicit user instructions
- **ALWAYS provide comprehensive testing instructions** for new features
- **UPDATE q/* files** when discovering new patterns or system requirements
- **FOLLOW all instructions** in q/startup.txt and related files

## ACTIVE CONTEXT
- **Working directory**: /Users/P2176038/Desktop/greg
- **Current branch**: main
- **Project**: Arcade games collection with enhanced system configuration
- **Focus**: System configuration and debug features for development workflow
- **Next**: Ready for testing bypass questions feature or additional enhancements

## RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS
If context overflows, user has implemented comprehensive system configuration with bypass questions feature for development workflow. System config includes game name toggle, progress reset with visual feedback, and question bypass system. All styling uses neon theme. Debug mode accessed via "gubed" query parameter. Test bypass feature thoroughly before considering complete.
