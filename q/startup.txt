# Q Startup Instructions
Last Updated: 2025-12-03T10:59:15.399-07:00

## HOW TO START A NEW Q SESSION
Use this exact prompt:
```
Please read and follow the instructions in /Users/P2176038/Desktop/greg/q/startup.txt and all related files in the /q directory before proceeding with any work.
```

## CONTEXT OVERFLOW DETECTION
**If Q seems to have lost context mid-conversation, the user should immediately use:**
```
Context overflow detected. Please read /Users/P2176038/Desktop/greg/q/startup.txt and /Users/P2176038/Desktop/greg/q/session_log.txt to recover context before continuing.
```

## CONTEXT OVERFLOW RECOVERY
If starting due to context window overflow, **read session_log.txt first** to understand:
- What was being worked on
- Recent commands executed
- Current project state
- How to continue from where we left off

## IMPORTANT: Q FILE MANAGEMENT
**All files in the /q directory are updatable by Q as needed.**

Q should:
- Update files with new learnings and patterns discovered during work
- Remove outdated information that is no longer relevant
- Decide what information is useful now vs. useful for all time
- Keep files current and practical for future sessions
- Add new files if needed for better organization
- **Update session_log.txt with recent commands and context**
- **Monitor code quality and prompt for refactoring when needed**

## QUICK START
1. Read all files in this /q directory before starting work
2. Check session_log.txt for recent context (especially after overflow)
3. Follow coding_standards.txt for all development work
4. Check project_state.txt for current status
5. Reference architecture.txt for system understanding
6. **Review code_quality.txt for refactoring opportunities**
7. Update relevant files as work progresses

## FILE STRUCTURE
- startup.txt (this file) - Main entry point and session instructions
- session_log.txt - Recent commands and context for overflow recovery
- coding_standards.txt - Development workflow and standards
- project_state.txt - Current project status and recent changes
- architecture.txt - System design and file structure
- common_issues.txt - Known problems and solutions
- recent_patterns.txt - Newly discovered patterns and learnings
- code_quality.txt - Code smell monitoring and refactoring guidance

## CORE PRINCIPLE
Always update these files as new information is discovered to maintain continuity across Q sessions. Keep information relevant and actionable. Proactively maintain code quality.
