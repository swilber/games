Last Updated: 2025-12-03T10:53:32.213-07:00

## HOW TO START A NEW Q SESSION
Use this exact prompt:
```
Please read and follow the instructions in /Users/P2176038/Desktop/greg/q/startup.txt and all related files in the /q directory before proceeding with any work.
```

## IMPORTANT: Q FILE MANAGEMENT
**All files in the /q directory are updatable by Q as needed.**

Q should:
- Update files with new learnings and patterns discovered during work
- Remove outdated information that is no longer relevant
- Decide what information is useful now vs. useful for all time
- Keep files current and practical for future sessions
- Add new files if needed for better organization

## QUICK START
1. Read all files in this /q directory before starting work
2. Follow coding_standards.txt for all development work
3. Check project_state.txt for current status
4. Reference architecture.txt for system understanding
5. Update relevant files as work progresses

## FILE STRUCTURE
- startup.txt (this file) - Main entry point and session instructions
- coding_standards.txt - Development workflow and standards
- project_state.txt - Current project status and recent changes
- architecture.txt - System design and file structure
- common_issues.txt - Known problems and solutions
- recent_patterns.txt - Newly discovered patterns and learnings

## CORE PRINCIPLE
Always update these files as new information is discovered to maintain continuity across Q sessions. Keep information relevant and actionable.
